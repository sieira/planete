*This module is part of plan√®te's core backend, whose docs can be found [here](../README.md)*

## Defaults

## Custom logger
This logger module allows to retrieve custom loggers

```js
  require('_/logger').new()
```
Returns a new instance of the logger that you can configure independently, allowing you to use separated loggers for each module

`:request-type :url request from :origin-ip`
