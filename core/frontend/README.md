# Core front-end
*For a general core reference, please check the [core readme](../README.md)*
The front-end is a particular case of back-end module, this means that it has to expose an index.js

## Routing
The decision has been taken to make the front-end expose its own routings to the back-end.
This, in an effort to completely separate the front-end from the back-end.
Any routing that expects to send a document generated by the front-end will be included in the routes folder.

For instance :

  1. Back-end side

  ```js
  server.post('/login', authentication.middleware);
  ```

  2. Front-end side

  ```js
  server.get('/login', function (req, res) {
    res.render('login');
  });
  ```

Although this may seem a bit confusing, it allows to plug any other front-end to the back-end, without constraining the front-end developer to design a particular set of documents, while keeps all the purely back-end API functions encapsulated in the backend module.
